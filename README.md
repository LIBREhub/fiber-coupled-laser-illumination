# Low-cost and modular fiber-coupled laser illumination for microscopy [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

The modular fiber-coupled laser illumination is a free and open-source system that features lasers with various wavelengths coupled in a single optic fiber, enabling easy digital selection without any structural modifications. The system is modular, allowing individual parts to be repurposed and improved in the open-source hardware sense, and easily combined, exchanged, or used on their own.

## How do I edit the documentation?

To edit the documentation you do not need to install anything, the documentation files can
be opened in a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad, Notepad++, gedit, VS Code, etc.
We recommend installing GitBuilding to preview any changes to the documentation.
GitBuilding also comes with a browser-based editor that has a live display of the final HTML documentation.

If you have ever used [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you will
notice that the files you are editing are markdown files. GitBuilding uses an extended
markdown syntax (that we call BuildUp). This allows you to keep track of parts in the
documentation. More detailed documentation is available on the
[GitBuilding website](https://gitbuilding.io). There is also additional
[syntax for configuration](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/buildconfsyntax), and for
[part libraries](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/builduplibrary/).
