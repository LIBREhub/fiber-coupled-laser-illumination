Laser-cutting acrylics is relatively simple. The basic steps for achieving good-quality cut acrylic parts are listed [here].

Settings for laser cutting acrylics will vary according to the machine. The table below lists the settings we used: 

|Setting     |Value        |
|------------|--           |
|Material    |Acrylic 3mm |
|Power (W)   |40 |
|Speed (mm/s)|20 |

We recommend testing the parameters for acrylic laser cutting using a test matrix. Download and laser cut the [test matrix](parts/materials/test-matrix.md) file. This will only use about an 8x9x0.5cm acrylic sheet.

The result should look like this:
